This project is one where we comapre unsupervised and supervised algorithms.
We choose K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from unsupervised category and Decision Tree (DT) from supervised category of algorithm.
Here, we perform the training and testing the census data using both K Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree.
We calculate the accuracies for both the methods.

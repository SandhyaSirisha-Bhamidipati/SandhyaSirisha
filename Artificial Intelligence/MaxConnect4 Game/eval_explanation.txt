Evaluation Function

Calculation of Utility Value from the evaluation function :

1) Check the streak which can make four concesutive cells, then check for three and finally two cells:
2) In the same way check for the opponents streak.
3) Then based on the below formula evaluate the utility value.

Utility Value = (fours*4 + threes*3 + twos*2) - (opp_fours*4 + opp_threes*3 + opp_twos*2).

4) The utility with highest value will be selected as the optimal stratergy.

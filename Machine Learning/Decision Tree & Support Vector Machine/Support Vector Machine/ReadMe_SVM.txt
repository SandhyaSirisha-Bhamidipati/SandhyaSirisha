Code structure:
The python file 'SVM.py' performs support vector machine analysis and returns the optimized output for the given dataset. Initially the weights of the 
weight vector(w) are initialized randomly. Later, the weights are updated upon every epoch and it finally returns the optimized weights along with predicted 
outputs and test prediction before optimization and after optimization.

How to run the code:
Open the Command line and change to the directory which contains the python file SVM.py
Then type 'python SVM.py' and you'll see the results before optimization and also a graph pops up showing the randomly initialized weight vector on the 
dataset before optimization. On closing the plot, after two-three seconds, the optimized weights along with the respective plot pops up. This is the weight 
vector (included with bias) after optimization.
